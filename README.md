## Book list viewer
### A project for personal use, currently WIP

Making the repo public now to keep the development process transparent, for anyone curious :)

Features:
- NextJS + Typescript + Prisma application
- SQLite database of books (with script for importing books from Mongo)
- Manage books (with metadata like the person suggesting the book)
- Manage book volumes (with availability at various online sellers)
- Manage individual volume copies (with tracking ownership status: is it owned, borrowed or gifted - and from/to whom)
- More to come...
